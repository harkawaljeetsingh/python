Arithmetic Operations
We can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

a = 10
b = 3

# Addition
sum = a + b  # 13

# Subtraction
difference = a - b  # 7

# Multiplication
product = a * b  # 30

# Division
quotient = a / b  # 3.3333...

# Floor Division (integer division)
floor_div = a // b  # 3

# Modulus (remainder)
remainder = a % b  # 1

# Exponentiation (power)
power = a ** b  # 1000
