Bitwise Operations
We can also perform bitwise operations on integers:

a = 10  # 1010 in binary
b = 3   # 0011 in binary

# Bitwise AND
bitwise_and = a & b  # 2 (0010 in binary)

# Bitwise OR
bitwise_or = a | b  # 11 (1011 in binary)

# Bitwise XOR
bitwise_xor = a ^ b  # 9 (1001 in binary)

# Bitwise NOT
bitwise_not = ~a  # -11 (inverts all bits)

# Bitwise left shift
left_shift = a << 1  # 20 (10100 in binary)

# Bitwise right shift
right_shift = a >> 1  # 5 (0101 in binary)
