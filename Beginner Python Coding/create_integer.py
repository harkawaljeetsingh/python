Creating an integer in Python is straightforward. We simply assign a whole number to a variable. Here are a few examples:


x = 5       # Positive integer
y = -3      # Negative integer
z = 0       # Zero


We can also create an integer from a string or a float using the `int()` function:


a = int("123")    # Converts string to integer
b = int(4.56)     # Converts float to integer (truncates the decimal part)
