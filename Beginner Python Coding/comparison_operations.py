Comparison Operations
We can compare integers using comparison operators:

a = 10
b = 3

# Equal to
is_equal = (a == b)  # False

# Not equal to
is_not_equal = (a != b)  # True

# Greater than
is_greater = (a > b)  # True

# Less than
is_less = (a < b)  # False

# Greater than or equal to
is_greater_equal = (a >= b)  # True

# Less than or equal to
is_less_equal = (a <= b)  # False
